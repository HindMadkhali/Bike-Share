## Bike-Share

# About the Project
This is my first data analysis project, where I explore bike share data to gain insights into usage patterns and trends. I use SQL (MySQL) for data cleaning and analysis and Tableau for creating visualizations.

# Project Objectives
Clean and prepare raw bike share data for analysis.
Analyze key metrics such as trip duration, user demographics, and popular stations.
Visualize the results to uncover trends and insights.

# Tools
SQL (MySQL): Querying and cleaning the data.

Tableau: Visualizing the data and creating dashboards.

# Files in This Repository
bike_share_analysis.sql: SQL queries used for data cleaning and analysis.

bike_share_viz: Tableau dashboards and visual files 

README.md: This file, documenting the project.

# Key Insights 
Briefly summarize the main findings of your analysis (e.g., busiest stations, popular times, user trends).

# Acknowledgments
Thanks to Bike Share Data Source for providing the dataset.
